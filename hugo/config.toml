There are *two main* usage scenarios.

**Remember:**\n
* Best use a `git submodule` workflow for your vendored repositories.
* For `sparse-checkout` on submodules, start with [this stackoverflow answer](https\\://stackoverflow.com/a/11778551).

**Next Steps:**\n
- Set up your Deployment Infrastructure.<sup>1</sup>
- Customize your CI/CD pipeline.<sup>2</sup>
- Join our growing [Telegram Community](https://t.me/joinchat/ILnVJw7s3ZvKL3mI7AACsw) to get help from other early birds.
- Submit a blog post of your journey to be chosen and linked as reference implementation of either scenario.

<sup>1</sup> [Odoo-Operator](https://xoe-labs.github.io/odoo-operator) will do canary deployments and operate review apps.<br/>
<sup>2</sup> We recomend [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) as the best available development lifecycle companion.

**Characteristics:**\n
* Module dependencies are vendored in `vendor/<ORG>/<REPO>/<MODULE>`<sup>1</sup>.
* `src` is used for custom development.
* It is best practice to version control configuration and meta-data.
* Such `custom_config` module satisfies the min. module condition.
* Uses the migration controller for orchestrated module upgrades.

<sup>1</sup> Use `sparse-checkout` to only get the modules you need.

      subtitle = """
**Characteristics:**\n
* Stable repos are vendored in `vendor/<MYORG>/<REPO>`.
* Module dependencies, if any, same as for Client Projects.
* `src` is used for pre-release module development.
* `src` is a shared workdir on the team's remote repo. <sup>1</sup>
* The team uses feature branches to develop new modules.
* After beta acceptance, the module is published in a vendored repo. <sup>2</sup>
* Further maintenance is done on that target repo.
* Uses the migration controller for migration script validation.

<sup>1</sup> **Nice:** `src` modules override their namesakes in vendored repos, as they are placed into `.../090`, the last (-> first) addon path.

<sup>2</sup> Use "Initial commit" to squash development history **or** `git subtree` commands to preserve it **or**, to get fancy, adopt a `git subrepo` workflow to keep disconnected histories in sync during beta phase.
